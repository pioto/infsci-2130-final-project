This is my final project from INFSCI 2130 (Decision Analysis and Decision
Support Systems). It is a simple system for estimating the "true cost" of
buying a piece of hardware, using ratings from sites like newegg as a proxy for
reliability.

It is built on the SMILE framework: http://genie.sis.pitt.edu/

Code was written by Mike Kelly

Model design was by Mike Kelly and Michelle Neustein.
